# NYCPre-KGuide

Using R Shiny, I created a comprehensive guide for parents who do not understand Universal Pre-K Program or simply want to quickly find the closest and most suitable pre-K for their children in NYC. The application also helps visualize whether there are enough seats for eligible kids in each borough.

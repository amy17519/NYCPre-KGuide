### Motivation

In 2013, Mayor De Blasio campaigned on a promise of universal pre-kindergarten. The program makes access to free pre-kindergarten education available to all NYC families, regardless of child’s abilities and family income. Now, three years later, NYC enrolls more children in full-day pre-K than any state except Georgia, and its preschool enrollment exceeds the total number of students in San Francisco or Boston. While the statistics show a positive outlook in early child education, the program received complaints and doubts from parents. Although every city child is promised a free seat, many children were slotted for schools miles away from their home. Also, as the number of pre-K locations increases to accommodate all four-year-old children, the quality of the education is in question.

This Pre-Kindergarten Explorer created can help parents who do not understand Universal Pre-K or simply want to find the closest and most suitable pre-K for their child. This Pre-K guide gives information about each pre-K’s location, contacts, meal plans, playspace, extended day care options, and enrollment restrictions. Also, it allows the public to visualize whether there are enough seats for eligible kids in each borough.

### Note
This was my second project at NYC Data Science Academy. Also, it was my first time using R Shiny to create a website for public use. If you happen to be a parent in New York City, I hope you find this website useful for planning your kid’s early education.
